I'm an enthusiast developer who loves programming 🙂👨‍💻

Currently I'm working with C#, ASP.NET Core, Azure Functions, JavaScript and API integrations, but I'm open to new horizons.

## Currently Studying

- F# Frameworks (Giraffe, Fable, Freya, SAFE Stack)
- Front-End (SASS, Less, React, Redux)

- Kotlin (for Back-end, mostly)
- Any weird or underrated technology/framework/language (just for fun)

I love technology, games and weird gadgets in general. I like to study all kind of stuff, from enterprise software solutions and frameworks to some weird languages and tools.
